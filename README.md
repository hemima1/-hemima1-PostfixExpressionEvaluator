# Postfix Expression Evaluator GUI

A Java Swing-based application that allows users to evaluate **arithmetic infix expressions** easily.  
The app automatically converts the infix expression into **postfix notation** (Reverse Polish Notation) and evaluates it step-by-step to display both the postfix expression and the final result.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: Automatically handles operator precedence and parentheses.
- **Postfix Evaluation**: Processes the postfix expression and computes the result accurately.
- **Error Handling**: Detects and reports invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Interactive GUI**: Simple and intuitive user interface built with Java Swing.
